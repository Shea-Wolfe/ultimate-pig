# Getting Started
In order to run these files you will need to enter $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you do so in your virtual environment.

As long as you have pig_sim.ipynb in the same directory you can open ipython notebook with the command $ ipython notebook.

In the notebook you can click on the pig_sim entry to view the data.

## Description
The solitaire version of Pig is played by taking 7 turns where you roll until you decide to stop and sum the rolls, but if you ever roll a one the turn ends and you get no points for the turn.

There are a number of graphs inside but the takeaway of the data is that for fairly simplistic models the ideal strategy seems to be to roll until you get to somewhere just over 20 or 21 and then hold.
